#You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i] represents the start and the end time of the ith interval. intervals is initially sorted in ascending order by start_i.
#You are given another interval newInterval = [start, end].
#Insert newInterval into intervals such that intervals is still sorted in ascending order by start_i and also intervals still does not have any overlapping intervals. You may merge the overlapping intervals if needed.
#Return intervals after adding newInterval.
