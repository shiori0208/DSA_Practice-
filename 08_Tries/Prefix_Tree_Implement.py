#A prefix tree (also known as a trie) is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a set of strings. Some applications of this data structure include auto-complete and spell checker systems.

#Input: 
#["Trie", "insert", "dog", "search", "dog", "search", "do", "startsWith", "do", "insert", "do", "search", "do"]

#Output:
#[null, null, true, false, true, null, true]
