#You are given an integer array hand where hand[i] is the value written on the ith card and an integer groupSize.
#You want to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size groupSize, and card values are consecutively increasing by 1.

#Input: hand = [1,2,4,2,3,5,3,4], groupSize = 4
#Output: true
