#You are given an array of integers nums, where nums[i] represents the maximum length of a jump towards the right from index i. For example, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any index i + j where:
#Return the minimum number of jumps to reach the last position in the array (index nums.length - 1). You may assume there is always a valid answer.

#Input: nums = [2,4,1,1,1,1]
#Output: 2
