#There are n gas stations along a circular route. You are given two integer arrays gas and cost where:
#gas[i] is the amount of gas at the ith station.
#cost[i] is the amount of gas needed to travel from the ith station to the (i + 1)th station. (The last station is connected to the first station)

#You have a car that can store an unlimited amount of gas, but you begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
#Return the starting gas station's index such that you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction. If it's impossible, then return -1.

#Input: gas = [1,2,3,4], cost = [2,2,4,1]
#Output: 3
