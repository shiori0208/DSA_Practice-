#You are given an integer array piles where piles[i] is the number of bananas in the ith pile. You are also given an integer h, which represents the number of hours you have to eat all the bananas.
#You may decide your bananas-per-hour eating rate of k. Each hour, you may choose a pile of bananas and eats k bananas from that pile.
#Return the minimum integer k such that you can eat all the bananas within h hours.

#Input: piles = [1,4,3,2], h = 9
#Output: 2
